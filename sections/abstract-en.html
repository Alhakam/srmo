<h2>Abstract</h2><span class="markdown">
The Stone Renovation Measures Ontology (SRMO) is an extension of the <a href="https://mathib.github.io/cto-ontology/#">Construction Tasks Ontology (CTO)</a> that provides specific classes for describing repair tasks on stone components and structures, especially for components made of natural stone. It is recommended to use the ontology in conjunction with the <a href="https://alhakam.github.io/nsd/">Natural Stone Damage Ontology (NSD)</a>, which describes natural stone damages on building elements that could be removed with renovation measures defined in SRMO. The classes were developed in the project <a href="https://www.bim-sis.de/">BIM-SIS</a>.
<p style="text-align: center;">The namespace for SRMO terms is https://w3id.org/srmo#</p>
<p align="center">The suggested prefix for the SRMO namespace is srmo</p><br>
